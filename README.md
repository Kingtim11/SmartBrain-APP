SmartBrain is a fully responsive app that was developed using React and NodeJS as part of Andrei Neagoie's ZeroToMastery course, "The Complete Web Developer". This app showcases an advanced image recognition system that leverages AI technology to accurately detect and identify faces within uploaded pictures.

Throughout the development process, I gained valuable insights into the seamless integration between front-end and back-end components, solidifying my understanding of full-stack development. It provided me with a comprehensive view of the app lifecycle, from design to deployment.

The front-end code for this app can be found in this repository. For the back-end code, please [click here](https://github.com/Kingtim11/SmartBrain-API).

Technologies utilised for the Front-End:
  * [React](https://reactjs.org/): A front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components.
  * [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/): A CSS toolkit that provides a set of predefined CSS classes for fast and           responsive styling.
