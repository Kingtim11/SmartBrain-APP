SmartBrain is a fully responsive App that was developed using React and NodeJS as part of Andrei Neagoie's ZeroToMastery course 'The Complete Web Developer'. This app was a great learning experience as it allowed me to understand the connection between front-end and back-end development. It also allowed me to experience the lifecycle of an app from design to deployment.

The front-end code for this app can be found in this repository. For the back-end code, please [click here](https://github.com/Kingtim11/SmartBrain-API).

Technologies used for the Front-End:
*React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces on the front-end.
*Tachyons: A CSS toolkit that provides a set of predefined CSS classes for fast and responsive styling.
